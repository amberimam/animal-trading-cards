# Animal Trading Cards
https://amberimam.github.io/animal-trading-cards/

This is the second project required by the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. We were given a design prototype and asked to use HTML and CSS to convert the prototype into a functional webpage. I chose to create a trading card about a Frog.
